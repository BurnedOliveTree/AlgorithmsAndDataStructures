### Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a little project of mine that started as a initiative to rewrite few of my smaller, older project, made with a [friend](https://github.com/pawelmuller) for university subject, written in Python, to a language that it actually makes sense to write algorithms or data structures in and also to clean up my C++ projects directory a bit.
